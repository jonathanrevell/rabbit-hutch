# rabbitmq-hutch
A wrapper to simplify dealing with multiple RabbitMQ queues or a continous stream of tasks

## Why Use Rabbit Hutch?

- Timeout handling to prevent tasks that never finish from freezing your application
- Simplified interaction with Rabbit, just provide the url, queue name and handler
- Improved console logging makes it more clear which tasks are running

## Installation

    // For npm
    npm install rabbitmq-hutch --save

    // For yarn
    yarn add rabbitmq-hutch

## Usage

    const RabbitHutch = require("rabbitmq-hutch");
    var hutch = new RabbitHutch("amqp://...");
    hutch.connect()
        .then(channel => {
            hutch.consumeQueue("my-queue", { timelimit: 1000 * 60 * 3 }, function(data, msg, ack, nack, cancelTimeout) {
                // Do some work
                // ...

                // Acknowledge once you've finished
                ack();
            })
        });


## Optional Express Integration
You may want to be able to run your functions through a REST call, maybe for testing, or maybe for other purposes.

If you are using express, or an express-like interface, you can pass it in to get URL endpoints automatically generated for each queue.

    var hutch = new RabbitHutch("amqp://...", { expressApp: app });
    hutch.connect()
        .then(() => {
            hutch.consumeQueue("my-queue", ...)
        });

    // Now you can use: manually send a message to the queue like so:
    // POST http://<YOUR-DOMAIN>/consume/my-queue

With the express integration, Hutch tries to mimic the normal message queue process as closely as possible, so it is a great way to test your queue consumer functions without having to run the full pipeline.
